            Recycle Master is a tool created for ToHacks22 where you are able to
            ask our friendly robot the Recycle Master whether your object
            belongs in the Blue Bin, Green Bin, Garbage Bin, Household Hazardous
            Waste, Drop Off Depot, Electronics, Metals, Oversized Item, Yard
            Waste, or is Not accepted.

            This project was built using next.js, and NLP from co:here to
            creatively respond to various disposable items. We utilized data
            from the City of Toronto to train the classifier model from co:here
            to generate responses and display the data through an interactive
            chat window. We implemented authentication to create a more personal
            experience with the user. Our friendly robot Recycle Master was
            created using Photoshop and animated using TailwindCSS.

            Amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, the world has centralized to live a
            hybrid focused lifestyle. It is more important now than ever for
            humans to understand where to dispose their waste. Improper waste
            disposal contaminates the water, harms the local ecosystem, and
            increases greenhouse gas emissions. Disposing your waste correctly
            is an important factor in helping the world reach net zero emissions
            and ultimately saving the planet.
